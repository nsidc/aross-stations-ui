    <h1>Welcome to the Arctic Rain on Snow Database App</h1>
    <p>This application allows you to query the database of Arctic rain on snow events, selecting one or more stations, displaying time-series and climatology plots of the data, and downloading data for selected points.  The database and this web application were built at part of the Arctic Rain on Snow Study (AROSS) funded by the National Science Foundations Navigating the New Arctic program</p>
    <p><a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1928230"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/NSF-1928230-red.svg" alt="National Science Foundation Award: 1928230"></a>.</p>
    <p>The database is built from reports from automatic weather stations in Arctic regions of North America, Greenland, Svalbard, Iceland, Scandanavia, and Russia.  Data were obtain from the <a href="https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/ASOS/">Iowa State University Environmental Mesonet</a> site.  Snow cover for station locations was extracted from the <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/g02156/versions/1">Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System</a> for dates after 2004, and from ERA5 prior to this data.  More information can be found on the Readme page of the <a href="https://github.com/andypbarrett/rain_on_snow_database">Rain on Snow Database GitHub repository</a>.</p>
    <p>Each station in the database is shown as a colored dot on the map.  The size and color or dots indicate the number of events reported for each station</p>

    <h2>How to Use the App</h2>
    <p><b>Hover</b> over a station with your cursor to see the station name and number of events reported</p>
    <p><b>Select</b> a station by clicking on a dot.  You can select multiple stations by pressing SHIFT and clicking on several dots</p>
    <p><b>Draw</b> a polygon around a group of stations by clicking <img src="assets/draw-polygon_1.svg" alt="Polygon icon" width=20px>.  Click on the map to start drawing a polygon, add vertices, and close the polygon by clicking on the first point again.</p>
    <p>The date range for data can be set by adjusting the dates on the left of the screen.</p>
    <p><b>Download</b> selected data by clicking on <img src="assets/download-data.svg" alt="Download icon" width=20px>.</p>
    <p>A time series of events for selected stations can be plotted by clicking <img src="assets/line-plot.svg" alt="Line plot icon" width=20px>.  If multiple stations are selected, the time series shows the sum of events on each day.</p>
    <p>A climatology of events for selected stations can be plotted by clicking <img src="assets/bar-chart.svg" alt="Bar chart icon" width=20px>.  The climatology is represented as the sum of events in each month for all selected stations.</p>
